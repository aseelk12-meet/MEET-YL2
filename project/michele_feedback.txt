I like the design a lot - it is clear and easy to use. I can immediately tell what I am supposed to do with the different pieces of the app. The one suggestion is if you could have figured out how to use text boxes instead of drop-down menus for setting the alarm time, that would have been more intuitive for a user.

In terms of the app itself, the alarm does not go off. When I get your screenshots, I can give you more specific feedback about the app and how to fix it.
